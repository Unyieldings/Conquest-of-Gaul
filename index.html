            <p class="Text">The Gauls, a mix of various Celtic tribes that resided in west-central Europe during the Iron Age, were the Celtic group whom we have the most historical knowledge. Like many Celtic tribes, they were a fearless and prideful community. The Gauls were a powerful force to be reckoned with. In the eyes of Julius Caesar, the Gauls were seen merely as obstacles to pass over to advance his political agenda for his campaign. This was the consensus by historians that there was no underlying fear of the Gauls that led Julius to conquering them, it was simply an opportunity he took to gain fame and glory through his writings: “Commentarii de Bello Gallico” (Commentaries on the Gallic War). Recounting his experiences observing and fighting with the Celts through his point of view. Julius Caesar’s conquest of Gaul (58-54BC) was a very crucial episode of the Iron Age which left its scars into the Celtic communities until today.</p>
            <p class="Text">The war was precluded when the Helveticans, a mixture of Celtic tribes who resided in modern-day Switzerland, migrated to the north. The romans were quite fearful of the increasing number of Celtic tribes in the north. Julius uses that source of fear as an opportunity to vanquish those. The Helveticans were trying to migrate to the south of France but to accomplish that journey, they had to step foot in Roman territories, an insult to a roman general. Julius Caesar responded felt that that was an unacceptable behaviour of the Celts. Originally, Julius had no interest in the Helveticans, but Rumania, a region where vast amounts of precious metals resided. Julius saw the trespassing of the Helveticans as a golden opportunity to impress the Roman Senate and the People’s Assembly. Caesar’s military base was located at lower Rhone and ordered his legions to destroy the bridge at Geneva which blocked the path along the Rhone river. This managed to slow down the Helveticans to give enough time for Julius to assemble two extra legions to his army and vanquished the Helveticans while they were trying to cross the Saone river (Jona Lendering, URL: www.livius.org/articles/person/caesar/caesar-04/). Julius and his legions defeated them again in Bibracte, the capital of Aedui. These victories encouraged Julius Caesar in his decision to conquer all of Gaul.</p>
            <p class="Text">Many battles have been waged between Julius’ legions against various Celtic tribes. Some of which, have sparked more attention than others in the eyes of the Roman people. In 55BCE, the Usipetes and the Tencteri, two celtic tribes, attempted to cross the Rhine during an armistice to establish themselves on the other side of the river. Caesar’s troupes attacked and slaughtered them all, many of whom were women and children. The people of the Roman Senate did not like that. Cato the Younger, one of Julius Caesar’s political rivals, had mentioned to hand him over to the Germanic tribe as punishment. To divert their attention, Julius ordered his engineers to rebuild the bridge over the Rhine As a way to traverse across.</p>

            <p class="Text">This model bridge represents the Rhine bridge Julius’ troops built to impress the Roman senate so that his war crimes be kept out of mind. Using the bridge that constructed, he used it as a power move” to intimidate the Germanic tribe, by sending off his legions of troops to cross the bridge to the other side of the Rhine and making them come back to let the Germanic tribes know that they can invade at any time. Its construction took 10 days to complete excluding the time it took for the accumulation of timber. Before deciding to build the bridge, Julius had considered crossing the Rhine with boats, but he deemed it too dangerous because of the rapids and also mentioned that boating across didn’t suit a man of his caliber, political motives aside, it was then that he had decided to build the bridge (Jona Lendering, URL: https://www.livius.org/sources/content/caesar/caesar-on-the-first-germanic-campaign/?).</p>
            <p class="Text">Although there were some similarities among the choice of weapons between the roman soldiers and the Celtic warriors, there were still some variations that we look at their primary weapon of choice, swords. Celtics utilizes long swords made of iron averaging of 3 feet in length, and having a hilt usually made of organic material such as wood, ivory, or bone. The hilts usually had an anthropomorphic shape to them resembling a human-animal hybrid. Aside from the gallic wars, this style of decoration was also present in Celtic art, tools and furniture. On the roman side, they wielded the gladius, officially known as Gladius Hispaniensis. Adopted after the second Punic war(200BC), the gladius came to be from the many adjustments the romans made based on their experiences fighting with many nations to form their ideal sword (Iron Age swords, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age_sword).</p>

            <p class="Text">What distinguished the Gauls even more from the roman army were their methods of combat. The roman troops fought in very structured and very organized legions consisting of many soldiers. The Celts on the other hand, favored ambushes more with a smaller number of warriors on average. they specialized in horseback riding and horse related warfare (chariots), and the Celtic culture glorified individual stand-off combats during battles to fuel their ego and to build their status in the tribe. Speaking of horse related warfare, the Celtic warriors thrived in combat with the use of chariots pulled by horses. With its high level of mobility, these chariots synchronized perfectly with the Celtic ambushing tactics. From long-distance, they would throw javelins and throwing spears at their enemies. When in close combat, the leader would disembark from the chariot and fight their adversaries in close quarters while the charioteers got themselves at a safe distance. An assistant would play the role of steering the chariot (the horses) and there would be another one who would take the leader’s place if he were injured. If leader would’ve been losing the dual or had felt cornered, they would’ve retreated in their chariots and fled (Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico).</p>

            <p class="Text">Celtic chariots are single-axed vehicles consisting of 2-wheels, rode by two horses or ponies, and usually with a driver and a warrior. The chariots were very noisy machines. Hearing distant sounds of hundreds of these chariots being mobilized during the advancement of Celtic troupes caused panic within the troupes of their adversaries. Chariots were implemented by the cavalry in the later iron age, the last recorded use of chariots was in 225BC during the battle of Telamon. The factions consisted of the alliance with the Boii and celtic tribes from northern Italy and the Alps, against Roman empire. Caesar recounted experiencing the chariots during the invasion of his troupes in Britain.</p>
            <p class="Text">During his conquest of Gaul, Julius also recounted his experiences with the war horns the Celtic tribes used called carnyces. These war horns were wind instruments, having a resonator in the tubing allowed the vibration of the air coming through the tube produced by the player, resulting in the production of very loud and powerful sounds. The carnyx is similar to trumpets, were long and carried an s-shape. The extreme height of these horns was to allow the sounds to not be muffled down by troupes present during ceremonies and preparations of war. The carnyx was very useful to raise moral and motivation of Celtic troupes before combat and to also psych up enemy troupes from afar by hearing their loud, powerful screeches.</p>
            <img class="Image" src="https://balkancelts.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/a-a-a-carnyx.jpg">
            <p class="Text">These instruments were made of bronze and were present throughout the majority of Celtic tribes during 300BC and 200AD. Usually the heads of the carnyx were shaped like a wild boar’s head. The word carnyx came from the gaulish root word “carn”, meaning “antler”, or “cern” meaning “horn”. The name also referred to Cernnunos, the horned God of fertility, life, wealth, animals and the underworld. The carnyces of Tintignac, differentiated themselves from the others by having a non-curved straight tube at the mouth-end. This made the player only able to play the instrument horizontally. Other families of carnyces (Deskford Carnyx) had a bend at the mouth-end, allowing them to play them vertically. The straight tubing of Tintignac carnyces had led historians to believe that there were other implications of using carnyces besides war. They could have been used for funerals, marriages and feasts (Ancient Origins URL:https://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/carnyx-ancient-trumpet-leading-celtic-warriors-battle-006019).</p>
            <p class="Text">Near the end of the Gallic war, Vercingetorix, chief of the Arveni, had managed to unite may Celtic tribes to revolt against the oppression of the Roman empire. Since their military might and training wasn’t as powerful and intricate as their oppressors, Vercingetorix and the Celtic alliance adopted a scorched earth tactic, which consisted of pillaging enemy farms, barracks and food storages to starve the roman soldiers of supplies needed to continue the war. This proved to be quite successful for the Gauls. However, Vercingetorix made a critical mistake which had led to the downfall of the Celtic army’s chances of success. He decided to mobilize and to barricade himself and the alliance into Uxellodunum, a giant Hillfort located in modern-day France. This allowed the roman army to surround the hillfort and to cut all escape routes, food and water supplies for the Celtic warriors. The latter did not have the capacity to fight anymore and consequently surrendered. This event was named the battle of Alesia (Battle of Alesia, URL:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alesia).</p>
            <p class="Text">Julius Caesar had decided to be very lenient with the treatment of the defeated Celtic warriors. Instead of punishing them with death or enslavement, he ordered all their right hands to be cut off so that they had no longer the ability to fight with a weapon efficiently. The right-handless warriors were also paraded throughout the Celtic regions as examples to demotivate and to instill fear to the Celtic communities. Vercingetorix aided in that outcome by asking for his troupes to be spared if he were to surrender. Vercingetorix was taken prisoner and later executed in front of the roman public. It was thus, that the Gallic war concluded and that the conquest of Gaul led by Julius Caesar had been complete.</p>

            <p class="Text">This statue is referred to as “The Dying Gaul” symbolizing the Celt’s defeat in the hands of the Roman Empire. Also a reminder of the bravery of the Celtic warriors. The sculpture illustrates a wounded gallic warrior on the ground giving the impression of being unable to continue the battle.</p>
